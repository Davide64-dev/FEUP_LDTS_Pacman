## LDTS_11_05 - PACMAN

In this project, we developed a pacman clone written in Java with the GUI Framework "Lanterna".
This project was developed by Tomás Pinto Macedo (up202108811@fe.up.pt), Davide Pinto Teixeira (up202109860@fe.up.pt) and Emanuel Rui Tavano Maia (up202107486@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2022⁄23.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

> List of implemented features and their descriptions. In the end of the section, include two or three screenshots that illustrate the most important features.

### PLANNED FEATURES

> List the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.

- **Menu** - An introductory screen that appears when the game is booted, it will display the name of the game, the creators and will allow you to start the first level when the "ENTER" key is pressed.
- **Levels** - Multiple arenas through which the player will traverse in a set order.
- **Player Character** - The player character (Pacman) will be able to move in 4 different directions depending on the key that is pressed: UP, when "W" is pressed, DOWN, when "S" is pressed, LEFT, when "A" is pressed and RIGHT, when "D" is pressed.
- **Enemy Characters** - There will be 4 enemy characters (Ghosts) which will chase Pacman until capture if in HunterState or run away from Pacman if in ChasedState. In the case of them being in HouseState or in EatenState they'll stay still and be unreachable by Pacman.
- **PacDots** - Pacman will be able to eat PacDots laid throughout the arena. When the arena is fully cleared of PacDots, the player will either proceed to the next one, or, in the case of it being the last one, will reach the WIN screen and beat the game.
- **PowerPellets** - These have all the features of normal PacDots, but, in addition of that, will cause them to change from HunterState to ChasedState through an ObserverPattern, during which Pacman will be able to eat ghosts.
- **Game Over Screen** - When Pacman is caught by the Ghosts, this screen will appear and allow you to restart the level.
- **Win Screen** - When the final level is finished, this screen will appear.
- **Multiple Lives** - Pacman will have 3 Lives per level,which means he will be able to be caught up to 2 times and simply respawn in the center of the level, before the Game Over Screen is reached and the points the player caught in the level are reset.

### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

**Example of one of such subsections**:

#### THE JUMP ACTION OF THE KANGAROOBOY SHOULD BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON ITS STATE

**Problem in Context**

There was a lot of scattered conditional logic when deciding how the KangarooBoy should behave when jumping, as the jumps should be different depending on the items that came to his possession during the game (an helix will alow him to fly, driking a potion will allow him to jump double the height, etc.). This is a violation of the **Single Responsability Principle**. We could concentrate all the conditional logic in the same method to circumscribe the issue to that one method but the **Single Responsability Principle** would still be violated.

**The Pattern**

![UML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114567030/204019036-f35442cd-63ac-4e0a-ab16-2f166c4f0c52.png)

We have applied the **State** pattern. This pattern allows you to represent different states with different subclasses. We can switch to a different state of the application by switching to another implementation (i.e., another subclass). This pattern allowed to address the identified problems because […].

**Implementation**

The following figure shows how the pattern’s roles were mapped to the application classes.

These classes can be found in the following files:

- [Character](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/Character.java)
- [JumpAbilityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/JumpAbilityState.java)
- [DoubleJumpState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/DoubleJumpState.java)
- [HelicopterState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/HelicopterState.java)
- [IncreasedGravityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/IncreasedGravityState.java)

**Consequences**

The use of the State Pattern in the current design allows the following benefits:

- The several states that represent the character’s hability to jump become explicit in the code, instead of relying on a series of flags.
- We don’t need to have a long set of conditional if or switch statements associated with the various states; instead, polimorphism is used to activate the right behavior.
- There are now more classes and instances to manage, but still in a reasonable number.

#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS AND REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.

**Example of such a subsection**:

------

#### DATA CLASS

The `PlatformSegment` class is a **Data Class**, as it contains only fields, and no behavior. This is problematic because […].

A way to improve the code would be to move the `isPlatformSegmentSolid()` method to the `PlatformSegment` class, as this logic is purely concerned with the `PlatformSegment` class.
